        <p class="para">Bread is a wonderful dish enjoyed all over the world. 
            It is a very simple dish often made of only four ingredients: 
            flour, water, salt, and yeast. I will be sharing one of my 
            favorite recipes for fresh homemade bread today.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ TBSP active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 ½ tsp salt</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> In a large bowl, or a stand mixer, dissolve 2 TBSP of the sugar in the warm water. 
                I just combine the two and whisk slightly to dissolve the sugar. Stir in yeast. 
                Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in remaining sugar, salt and oil. Begin to mix, using a rubber scraper or the dough hook on your stand mixer. 
                Add the flour one cup at a time, reserving the last cup of flour to see if you need it. 
                You might not use all of the flour. 
                The dough should pull away and clean the bowl, 
                sticking on the bottom in a small circle about the size of a quarter.
                If your dough does this with just 5 cups of flour, do not add more. 
                However, if your dough still sticks to the bowl, add more a couple tablespoons at a time 
                until it cleans the bowl, sticking in just a small circle on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Now knead dough for 7 minutes. Set a timer as a full knead is important! 
                Place in a well oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. 
                Cover with a damp cloth. 
                Allow to rise in a warm area until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Punch dough down. Knead for 1 minute and divide dough in half. 
                Shape into loaves and place into two greased 9*5 inch loaf pans. 
                Allow to rise for 30 minutes, 
                or until dough has risen 1 inch above pans.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350° F (175° C) for 30-40 minutes. 
                Cool, brush with butter and enjoy!</li>
